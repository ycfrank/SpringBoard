### Conceptual Exercise

What are important differences between Python and JavaScript?

Javascript is ran on both browser and server and Pyhthon is mostly used for server side programming.

Given a dictionary like {"a": 1, "b": 2}: , list two ways you can try to get a missing key (like "c") without your programming crashing.

{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3} (GET function) **** A method that returns the value for the given key, if present in the dictionary. If not, then it will return None (if get() is used with only one argument)

What is a unit test?

Separate testable parts of code. An individual program, class, method, function etc.

What is an integration test?

Individual pieces of code are combined and tested as a group.

What is the role of web application framework, like Flask?

A application used with Python that provides tools and libraries that help build web application. flask-debugtoolbar is one example of tools used for debugging and testing.

You can pass information to Flask either as a parameter in a route URL (like '/foods/pretzel') or using a URL query param (like 'foods?type=pretzel'). How might you choose which one is a better fit for an application?

route URL vs Param **** Query string is always a part of the URL. Parameters can be buried in form-data datastream when using POST method so they may not appear in the URL

How do you collect data from a URL placeholder parameter using Flask?

from flask import request

@app.route(...) def login(): >username = request.args.get('username')

How do you collect data from the query string using Flask?

from flask import request

@app.route('/data') def data(): >user=some-value) >user = request.args.get('user')

How do you collect data from the body of the request using Flask?

from flask import request

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST']) def parse_request(): >data = request.data

What is a cookie and what kinds of things are they commonly used for?

Cookies collect user data stored on the user's computer web browser.

What is the session object in Flask?

Session data is stored on the server.

What does Flask's jsonify() do?

Creates a response with the JSON code Example: from flask import jsonify

@app.route('/_get_current_user') def get_current_user(): >return jsonify(username=g.user.username, >email=g.user.email, >id=g.user.id)
